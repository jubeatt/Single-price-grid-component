## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

- [reset.css](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) - For style
- [box-shadow-generator](https://html-css-js.com/css/generator/box-shadow/) - For style

### What I learned

```css
.price_grid {
  width: 85%;
  min-width: 320px;
  max-width: 960px;
}
```

- `width: 85%`  
  To Make the element is fluid, so it can change its width following the window.

- `min-width: 320px`  
  To restrict the element's minimum width, (to prevent it's too small when on a small screen or resolution)

- `max-width: 960px`  
  To restrict the element's maximum width, (to prevent it's too big when on a large screen or resolution)

```css
.row {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  padding: 20px 30px 30px;
}
```

- `box-sizing: border-box`  
  Because we set padding to the element, so we have to change the calculation of box modal, and then it won't be overflow by its width from the container.

```css
.row:nth-child(2) .price {
  display: inline-block;
  vertical-align: middle;
}
```

- `display: inline-block`  
  To make "$29" and "per month" side by side.
- `vertical-align: middle`  
  To make "$29" and "per month" center aligned.

```css
.btn {
  max-width: 250px;
}
```

- `max-width: 250px`  
  To restrict the button max-width, so it won't be scaled too
  large on desktop version.

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 760px) {
  body {
    height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
  }
}
```

For desktop, our goal is to set the component to the middle of the layout.  
So first we set `display: flex` to create a flex-box from body,  
and then we set `height: 100vh`, to make its height equal to viewport (by the browser window)  
and we use `flex-direction: column` and `justify-content: center` to implement our goal.  
(Change main-axis direction to column / make flex-item object can be center of main-axis from the flex-box.)

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 760px) {
  .price_grid {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
  }
}
```

Because the default value of `flex-wrap` is `nowrap`, so we change it to `wrap`.  
So the flex-item in flex-box can be wrap now.

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 760px) {
  .row:nth-child(1) {
    flex-basis: 100%;
  }
}
```

It's for this:

![row-01](README-img/row-01.jpg)

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 760px) {
  .row:nth-child(2) {
    flex-basis: 50%;
  }
  .row:nth-child(3) {
    flex-basis: 50%;
  }
}
```

It's for this:

![row-02](README-img/row-02.jpg)

Additionally, because the default setting for flex-item will make them have the same height. so if we don't change the setting, it will seem not symmetrical by the view. like this:

![equal-height](README-img/equal-height.jpg)

If you still don't know what that means, you can the following test :

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 760px) {
  .price_grid {
    align-items: flex-start;
  }
}
```

![flex-start](README-img/flex-start.jpg)

To fix this problem, we can add the following code:

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 760px) {
  .row:nth-child(2) {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: space-around;
  }
}
```

- `display: flex`  
  Create a flex-box.
- `flex-direction: column`  
  Change the direction of main axis to column.
- `justify-content: space-around`  
  Make flex-items are Equal spacing.

Finally, you finished it:

![row-02](README-img/row-02.jpg)

Here is the last part. Call-To-Action effect for the sign-up button:

![CTA](README-img/CTA.gif)

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 760px) {
  .btn {
    transition: background-color 0.5s;
  }
  .btn:hover {
    background-color: hsl(71, 73%, 30%);
  }
}
```

## Acknowledgments

This is my first completion challenge of Frontend Mentor.  
Although it's just a small project, it reminds me of some skills I have learned before.  
I hope I could keep trying to finish the rest of the challenges in the future.

In the end, I want to say thank you to the author who created this platform.  
It helps people who are learning programs, just like me.
